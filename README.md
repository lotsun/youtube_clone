# Getting Started with Create React App
This is a modern web development by building a responsive React JS application consisting of stunning video sections, custom categories, channel pages, and, most importantly, videos can be played straight from the YouTube Clone App!

This platform is built on React.js, Material UI, and just a couple of other dependencies.
In the process of building this platform, i learnt more about: 
- React functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- You'll achieve mastery using Material UI (version 5)
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness on all devices
- And most importantly, fetching data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI.
